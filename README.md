 <h5>Welcome to one of my first projects </h5>
<p>Sokoban is a classic puzzle game that challenges players to move boxes to their designated locations in a warehouse setting. The game features an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing players to easily move boxes using the arrow keys on their keyboard. As a developer, I take pride in creating a game that is both fun and challenging while utilizing only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
